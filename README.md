As part of my front-end development work, I built an interactive Tic Tac Toe Game with several enhanced features to improve user experience. The project is designed with a simple, intuitive interface, making it fun and easy to play.

Key features include the ability for players to choose custom icons, adding a personalized touch to the game. I also incorporated a reset game button, allowing users to restart the game at any time without refreshing the page, ensuring smoother gameplay.

The game is equipped with clear validation checks to prevent invalid moves, ensuring that players cannot select the same cell twice or continue playing once a player has won. These checks improve the game's reliability and functionality.

Additionally, I focused on a clean and dynamic user interface. The game board and reset button are only displayed after the player initiates the game, reducing visual clutter on the page. Each player's turn is prominently indicated during the game to maintain clarity and engagement throughout each round.

This project demonstrates my ability to create interactive web applications with custom functionality, solid user experience design, and attention to small details that enhance the overall user experience. The code is organized, scalable, and easy to maintain for future improvements.
